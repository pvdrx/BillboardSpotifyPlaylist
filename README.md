# BillboardSpotifyPlaylist

things that my help if you want to run this code
login in https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ and create a new app
get your CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET and replace in the start of the code
its better if you have the spotify desktop app to see if is working
you can change the name of the playlist on the end of the code
the spotify module documentation is here https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/
this https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/#ids-uris-and-urls explaing the empty list on the
start of the code, that list will store all the objects that have the details of the music
