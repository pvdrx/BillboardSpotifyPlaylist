# BillboardSpotifyPlaylist
I created a project uses the Spotify API to create a playlist with the 100 most played songs on a given date, this date and song names are extracted using beautifulsoup

things that my help if you want to run this code

login in https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ and create a new app

get your CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET and replace in the start of the code

its better if you have the spotify desktop app to see if is working

you can change the name of the playlist on the end of the code

the spotify module documentation is here https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/

this https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/#ids-uris-and-urls explaing the empty list on the

start of the code, that list will store all the objects that have the details of the music
